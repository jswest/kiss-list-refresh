# KISS LIST

This is the story of one artist's first kiss with everyone she ever kissed.

### Notes

You should be able to just `git clone` this repo, and run your favorite simple webserver in the `public/` folder.

The `public/vendor/` folder is all taken from running `npm install` and then `cp`-ing the builds of those packages into that folder from `node_modules/`.

This project was originally from 2013, but I refreshed it this year.
