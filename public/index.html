					These are the stories of my first kisses with everyone I’ve

				<p><span class="name">Notes from Galen in 2013</span></p>
				<p>
					I started kissing people when I was almost 15. I’ll tell you
					this: we were sober, it wasn’t the last time we kissed, we
					talked a lot after. All of that information is here, written
					out in the graphs. What’s not here: we were in a bed, it was
					after midnight, I read <em>Harry Potter</em> later, when I
					couldn’t sleep.
				</p>
				<p>
					I didn’t start keeping a kiss list at the beginning. In
					fact, it took seven and half years before I wrote down
					everyone’s names, and another six months before I thought of
					it as more than just a list of experiences. It was also a
					list of data that, perhaps, could tell me something about
					myself—what I liked, or what my type was. These graphs
					attempt to answer those questions. The records start with my
					first kiss and end when I began this project. The graphs
					represent my first kiss with each person I kissed, and the
					data included represents what for me are the essential facts
					that make up each experience. For the most part, no two
					kisses overlap. Each encounter is unique, but maybe by
					breaking the experiences, and those involved, into their
					component parts, I could find something cohesive about the
					people I was intimate with and uncover a pattern about
					myself.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started keeping journals when I was around 10. Since the
					beginning, they’ve meandered through what I did and how I
					felt, with an emphasis on Not Forgetting. For the last two
					years of middle school, I wrote every night before I went to
					sleep. These entries crossed the mundane and the important:
					Today I skipped soccer practice and got ice cream; today my
					crush and I read aloud from
					<em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> in English class; today I
					started wearing a bra. The journals slowed slightly in high
					school, but by college they were back, with the lens now
					focused on how I felt and what that meant—in part about the
					experiences, but mostly about me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Much of the information here I gleaned from my journals
					(and, for things like sun sign, from Facebook) but the
					majority comes from my memories. It only represents my
					experience, of course, except for a few externally-derived
					truths (age, sign, the difference between a 0 and anything
					above that on the intoxication scale) but some of the
					subjective views were written hours later, and some look
					back from today. What I wrote directly after is as close as
					I could get to a fact of the moment. All of it is at least
					somewhat fictionalized—as memory fictionalizes
					everything—but I tried to paint for myself, as accurately as
					possible, a picture of what happened, and of how I felt.
				</p>
				<p>
					The stories I wrote or remember aren’t necessarily true;
					what’s true is the data. There are irrefutable facts to
					every kiss. In extracting these pieces of information, I
					determine a set of details that makes up each experience and
					that describes, as objectively as possible, a truth.
					However, these facts can’t be reassembled into an image.
					Even if I had data for every variable, from the weather
					outside to the background noise, there’s a quality to the
					scene that statistics can’t express. An experience, teased
					out into its component parts, loses some essential,
					experiential quality. The information provided with each
					data point paints a picture, and each correlation provides a
					narrative, but there’s no self that joins the data. It’s the
					language that defines the story as much as the plot points,
					and it’s the language that’s missing here. And so, as you
					read the information, you also read into it, and through
					this action, create the narrative. I give you a series of
					facts, but you author the image.
				</p>
				<p>
					The data provided is limited by memory and by authorial
					choice. The graphs only show what happened in the first
					kiss; they don’t show how many timesg we kissed, how much I
					loved or hated the person, or how complicated those feelings
					may have been to disentangle. The data can’t tell you who
					the kisser is, and even if I said their names, it wouldn’t
					let you know them. Truth be told, it doesn’t let you know me
					either. Even I’m surprised how difficult it can be to find
					patterns in my behavior. I want to create a person who
					always likes kissing sober, or who kisses aquarian boys
					most, or who feels more shame the less she knows the person,
					but it’s not always the case. The data builds a story, but
					the story only goes so far. There’s something irreducible
					about it—some fact of attraction and pleasure, some sum
					that’s more than the parts. This is the identifiable but
					unpointoutable experience that exists in the crossection of
					these facts. It’s an understanding you won’t find here
					because it exists on an ungraphable plane.
				</p>
				<p>
					Much of the information displayed for each kiss represents
					my individual experience of the encounter—my enjoyment,
					shame, understanding of how much we talked afterwards, and
					so on—but some of the statistics, including what appears in
					the “Who” section, refer to the kissers themselves. Most of
					this personal data is subjective, but that is especially
					true when it comes to gender and sexual orientation. I am
					classifying based on my understanding of another person, and
					this understanding may be wrong. If I misrepresented any
					kissers, I’m sorry.
