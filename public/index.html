					These are the stories of my first kisses with everyone I’ve

				<h1>Galen (2013)</h1>
				<p>
					I started kissing people when I was almost 15. I’ll tell you
					this: we were sober, it wasn’t the last time we kissed, we
					talked a lot after. All of that information is here, written
					out in the graphs. What’s not here: we were in a bed, it was
					after midnight, I read <em>Harry Potter</em> later, when I
					couldn’t sleep.
				</p>
				<p>
					I didn’t start keeping a kiss list at the beginning. In
					fact, it took seven and half years before I wrote down
					everyone’s names, and another six months before I thought of
					it as more than just a list of experiences. It was also a
					list of data that, perhaps, could tell me something about
					myself—what I liked, or what my type was. These graphs
					attempt to answer those questions. The records start with my
					first kiss and end when I began this project. The graphs
					represent my first kiss with each person I kissed, and the
					data included represents what for me are the essential facts
					that make up each experience. For the most part, no two
					kisses overlap. Each encounter is unique, but maybe by
					breaking the experiences, and those involved, into their
					component parts, I could find something cohesive about the
					people I was intimate with and uncover a pattern about
					myself.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started keeping journals when I was around 10. Since the
					beginning, they’ve meandered through what I did and how I
					felt, with an emphasis on Not Forgetting. For the last two
					years of middle school, I wrote every night before I went to
					sleep. These entries crossed the mundane and the important:
					Today I skipped soccer practice and got ice cream; today my
					crush and I read aloud from
					<em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> in English class; today I
					started wearing a bra. The journals slowed slightly in high
					school, but by college they were back, with the lens now
					focused on how I felt and what that meant—in part about the
					experiences, but mostly about me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Much of the information here I gleaned from my journals
					(and, for things like sun sign, from Facebook) but the
					majority comes from my memories. It only represents my
					experience, of course, except for a few externally-derived
					truths (age, sign, the difference between a 0 and anything
					above that on the intoxication scale) but some of the
					subjective views were written hours later, and some look
					back from today. What I wrote directly after is as close as
					I could get to a fact of the moment. All of it is at least
					somewhat fictionalized—as memory fictionalizes
					everything—but I tried to paint for myself, as accurately as
					possible, a picture of what happened, and of how I felt.
				</p>
				<p>
					The stories I wrote or remember aren’t necessarily true;
					what’s true is the data. There are irrefutable facts to
					every kiss. In extracting these pieces of information, I
					determine a set of details that makes up each experience and
					that describes, as objectively as possible, a truth.
					However, these facts can’t be reassembled into an image.
					Even if I had data for every variable, from the weather
					outside to the background noise, there’s a quality to the
					scene that statistics can’t express. An experience, teased
					out into its component parts, loses some essential,
					experiential quality. The information provided with each
					data point paints a picture, and each correlation provides a
					narrative, but there’s no self that joins the data. It’s the
					language that defines the story as much as the plot points,
					and it’s the language that’s missing here. And so, as you
					read the information, you also read into it, and through
					this action, create the narrative. I give you a series of
					facts, but you author the image.
				</p>
				<p>
					The data provided is limited by memory and by authorial
					choice. The graphs only show what happened in the first
					kiss; they don’t show how many timesg we kissed, how much I
					loved or hated the person, or how complicated those feelings
					may have been to disentangle. The data can’t tell you who
					the kisser is, and even if I said their names, it wouldn’t
					let you know them. Truth be told, it doesn’t let you know me
					either. Even I’m surprised how difficult it can be to find
					patterns in my behavior. I want to create a person who
					always likes kissing sober, or who kisses aquarian boys
					most, or who feels more shame the less she knows the person,
					but it’s not always the case. The data builds a story, but
					the story only goes so far. There’s something irreducible
					about it—some fact of attraction and pleasure, some sum
					that’s more than the parts. This is the identifiable but
					unpointoutable experience that exists in the crossection of
					these facts. It’s an understanding you won’t find here
					because it exists on an ungraphable plane.
				</p>
				<p>
					Much of the information displayed for each kiss represents
					my individual experience of the encounter—my enjoyment,
					shame, understanding of how much we talked afterwards, and
					so on—but some of the statistics, including what appears in
					the “Who” section, refer to the kissers themselves. Most of
					this personal data is subjective, but that is especially
					true when it comes to gender and sexual orientation. I am
					classifying based on my understanding of another person, and
					this understanding may be wrong. If I misrepresented any
					kissers, I’m sorry.

				<h1>John (2013)</h1>
				<p>
					Here is a fact: In the middle of Orion’s Belt, there is a
					large blue supergiant that burns many times brighter than
					our sun. Here is a story: When I was a child, I went with my
					mother to the planetarium. I felt small when I learned that
					Orion was a hunter, and he chased the seven sisters all the
					way up to the sky.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here’s another story: I read Galen Beebe's work for the
					first time sprawled on a too-hard bed in a hotel just
					outside Madison, Wisconsin. Three years later, I helped
					publish a chapbook of her poetry. Five years later, Galen
					and I talked, and she told me she wanted to make a series of
					charts and graphs about everyone she’d ever kissed.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is what we didn't talk about: I actually met Galen over
					greasy pizza four years ago. I had already read her work.
					Sometime later, Galen and I went bowling; I made her dinner;
					we watched The Breakfast Club, which she had never seen; we
					did the dances from The Breakfast Club—she, the boys’ dance
					and I, the girls’; and we kissed. Sometime after that, I was
					sitting at a computer in the library, doing what I could to
					avoid studying, when Galen walked up to me, looking nervous,
					and said that she wanted to talk. I was half right when I
					thought that we probably weren't going to kiss again.
				</p>
				<p>
					You'll find most of this story in this book. I am, if you're
					wondering, number 23. Heartbreakingly, our kiss was rated 3
					(or, "My stomach is sledding") out of 4 for enjoyment.
					You'll find if Galen was ashamed after. You'll find how far
					things went that first time we kissed. You'll find my sun
					sign and my gender and my sex. All the things you’ll find
					are true, and if I had to guess, you'll find yourself
					wanting a whole lot more.
				</p>
				<p>
					But long strands of yarn tangle and bunch in unexpected
					ways. The story you just read is knotted stubbornly to most
					every other story I have. In telling the story of how we
					met, I'd need to tell you about late-night poker games and
					handmade tables. I'd need to tell you about the bitter taste
					of scotch and Facebook messages from friends of friends. As
					for the story of how things ended—well, let's just say I
					left some things out.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mabe yarn is the wrong metaphor. Maybe it would be better to
					imagine the facts of our lives as stars and our stories as
					the constellations we draw between them. First, we connect
					the dots, draw lines in the sky. Then we see a spectral
					figure, shimmering in the night. Now, Orion is a hunter, and
					he's larger than life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Maybe it would be better to tell you about the stars
					themselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here is the beginning of another story: one night in August,
					sitting on a dock under the stars, Galen and I kissed.
					You'll find that tidbit of information as “last kiss?” in
					the graphs. But the graphs won't tell you that we held hands
					first. They won't tell you about the woman at the checkout
					counter who made fun of my hickey. They won't tell you what
					we're like now.
				</p>
				<p>
					Orion was a hunter, and he chased the seven sisters all the
					way up to the sky. <em>Kiss List</em> burns bright with
					stars; we’ll leave it to you to connect them.
