	who: [
		`Tongue. Teeth. Lips (an afterthought). A nervous breath on my shoulder and small-talk in the pauses. My knee taps against hers and my stomach leaps down into my knee. Her shoulder whispers something. I lean closer. Maybe it was her eyelashes. I tilt my head.

It takes two to join together. Two people trying to crawl into each other. A meeting—closer than a handshake, though not by much. I have no weapons, one tongue says. My teeth are sharp, says the other. A blush. A rush. A negotiation. A face interrupts mine, and my hands rest on a body that’s like or unlike my own. I keep my eyes open. His are closed. Kissing is not just about lips.`,
		`We met at a party. We met in class. I've known him since middle school. We've never spoken. I’ve always liked her. We shared a tent. Her eyes are blue like light on a lake. He’s a friend of a friend. I don't know how we met. I want to wake up next to him. He’s a cool guy. He’s generally thought to be cool although I don’t particularly like him. We read aloud to each other. We talk about it first. I never see him again. We're just friends. We're "just friends." We don't talk at all. She has a boyfriend somewhere. He’s older than I am, and we’re at an age when age still matters.`,
		`There’s pressure to have pleasure. He’s cute, she’s funny, they like you. A shy glance. Accidental flirting. At the end of a date that isn’t bad, there’s a want to want. Have another drink. Let’s take a walk. Trees are losing their leaves above us. A curtain falling. His hand loops into mine. We stop. The knowledge a moment before what happens happens. Another leaf loosens.

Discovering where I end. Is it where his mouth enters? When I disappear into her? When he and I become something that is neither he nor I? Can the people watching see this happen? There’s something oblivious about it all. A disappearing room. An entry point to an experience that is utterly its own.`

	what: [
		`Often it’s nice. A scramble before leaving. A last-chance possibility. I follow him through the room with my eyes and try to hold on as he walks through the door. Later, we stand breathing-distance apart beneath the arch in Washington Square, and my heart has a foot off the diving board. I want to step forward, but I’m scared of sinking or floundering or my bathing suit riding up. Still, I let myself fall, and then my face touches the water’s face. It takes a moment to adjust. This is me, underwater. I can’t quite breathe, but I don’t quite want to. My stomach slips away and swims into the deep end, and I think I might be drowning.`,
		`Sometimes it’s quick: Hey, what’s your name?—and then. Or not even that. Hey—and then. Or just—then. Pressed together. Lips locked and dancing. A bell rings inside me when I step into another person and forget myself. When I remember another time I forgot myself. A kiss goes beyond a kiss and into memory and knowledge for later. Speaking many languages at once. Holding hands. The bubbling thrill of acting on it, of learning to read myself, to tell myself what I want and to say yes, or no, when I want to.`,
		`It’s not always pleasant. Hurried hands and let’s not. A tension pulling forward. A call to ignore. Sometimes there’s the question: Should I? But often the better questions: Can I, is this, do you? And the best answers: Please, let’s. A hand on my stomach. The button on my blouse. There’s a pressure—and pleasure. Put your lips on my lips. Put your hands in my hands. Lay your forehead here on mine. We move past first base, past second base, past bases and off the field. I walk down a new street and still recognize myself.`

	where: [
		`On the quad after a party, by the roots of a tree. In his dorm room when his roommate’s out. In the house I grew up in. In her childhood bedroom. In the kitchen while I’m on the phone and laughing. Against a car, against a fence, against my better judgment. On the dock. Behind his back. On an operating table in my dream. Outside the fortune teller’s.

A place that was known for nothing becomes an experience. The doorway by the stairs, the hallway of my dorm. A body known for many things finds a new understanding. A mouth is for smiling, frowning, talking, eating — and now, something else. I’m inventing a language at the same time as discovering what I want to say.`,
		`By the train he’s about to get on. In a house I’ll soon move out of. On a bench in the park. On a couch in his parents’ house in the dark. On a dance floor in a sudden move. In a closet wallpapered in tinfoil. In a lake, wearing a life jacket. In the basement. In the attic. Among things we call junk but can’t get rid of. Outside the bar when our friends are inside. On the edge of a boat when the sun is high. By the Hudson at night. Driving through cornfields whose tops are turning yellow. Walking through fresh snow. Outside the deli by school. In my doorway, where I’ve kissed before.`,
		`Outside the library, where people can see us. At Six Flags Great Adventure. By the window on a bus. In the checkout aisle of the supermarket. 30,000 feet above the Atlantic. By a closed exhibit in the museum. In a taxi on the way home. In his room while Jack Johnson is playing. Somewhere I didn’t recognize and wouldn’t know now. In the lobby of a place I’ve never been back to. In a parking lot in a foreign country.

Our ghosts are still kissing there, by the tree. Also in a room of strangers, under a blanket of music, and in the locker room while there are leaves falling in my stomach.`

	when: [
		`During a fast song while we’re in costume. At the end of our third date. At midnight on New Years Eve when we’re both holding sparklers and everyone around us is shouting. When he’s heavy-hearted and smells like cigarettes. In between sets. After I talk it over with my friend, and realize I don’t care what happens. As he gets into his car. While waiting for water to boil. After we’ve broken up. When we’re lying in bed and I can hear the neighbors arguing. On Saint Patrick’s Day. When I’m not sure if I want to. When I’m not sure of anything. When we’ve finally admitted we like each other, and we’re both feeling shy.`,
		`When my heart is drowning. When there are good reasons not to. In the living room at a party when my nail polish is still wet and I don’t know where we’ll be six months from now. On what will later be our anniversary. When it’s pouring outside and I wish it weren’t. On the first day of fall break. While we’re getting dressed. When it’s too cold to feel our noses. When it’s been six months. During the first movie date I ever go on. When I think I’m getting sick. While watching _Catwoman_. While watching _Full House_. While watching commercials. After we get lost in the car and I tell him to turn off the GPS because I don’t mind wandering.`,
		`After months of nothing more than hugs and cuddles. When we aren’t dating. When he’s just met my parents. A week before I move away. Right after we get off the tandem bike. While we’re making birthday cake and I feel giddy. For the first time ever. When we’re sitting on the steps outside and they say their boots feel heavy. After he apologizes. When I just dreamed I was kissing someone else. When we’re finally in the same place and I thought this might never happen. On a Saturday morning when I’m half asleep and the dog is whining at the door. When she’s wearing her glasses and it feels strange to look at her. A cluster of kisses in a row.`
